# Racing Simulation
## Description
This project is a 2D racing simulation developed using OpenGL and GLFW library in C++. It provides a graphical window where cars move around two separate rectangular tracks, simulating a race. Each car is represented by a colored rectangle and has its own thread controlling its movement. This project is divided into three stages, each aimed at adding new features and improving functionality:
- **Stage 1:**
  - New vehicles enter the first track with random delays and circle at a random constant speed.
  - Vehicles on the first track leave the track after completing 3 laps.
  - A fixed number of vehicles (e.g., 3 vehicles) circulate on the second track, randomly distributed on the track at the initial moment, all at the same constant speed.
  - Vehicles are distinguishable by using different colors.
  - The program ends when the space key is pressed. The program must not terminate before all threads have finished.
- **Stage 2: TBA**
- **Stage 3: TBA**
